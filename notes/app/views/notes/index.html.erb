<h2>Select your class</h2><select name="course">

</select>
<p>
    <%= link_to 'Class 1', notes_class1_path %><!--TODO put this in the dropdown-->

</p>

<!--to put the link in the dropdown just put the following in the dropdown:
<option value="Software Engineering"><a href="class1">Software Engineering</a></option>
the only thing left after that is to make something happen so that you will get to its notes page. maybe by the click of a submit button?-->
